Meat-Backend-RF

This repository houses the refactored backend for the Meat application, focusing on a robust, scalable, and secure architecture.
‚ú® Features

    Authentication & Authorization: Implemented with role-based middleware for secure access control.
    Database Layer:
        Development: SQLite
        Production: PostgreSQL with migrations for seamless schema evolution.
    File Storage: Currently local, with plans for cloud integration.
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
        Predefined roles: admin, manager, customer.
        Granular permissions for fine-grained control.
        Middleware for route-level protection, ensuring scalable security.
    Service Layer Pattern:
        Clear separation of concerns: API routes manage HTTP requests, while services handle core business logic.
        Enhanced testability of individual components.

üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Highlights

    Users Table: Includes user roles for authorization.
    Orders Table: Manages all order-related data.
    Roles/Permissions: Defines the access hierarchy and permissions.
    Analytics Cache: Stores pre-computed metrics for quick retrieval.

üìä Analytics Service

A standalone service designed for comprehensive data analysis:

    Scheduled Jobs: Automates data processing and metric computation.
    Metrics Storage: Dedicated storage for all analytics data.
    Dashboard API: Provides data for an interactive dashboard.

üîí Security Measures

The backend incorporates several security best practices:

    RBAC Middleware: Enforces access control at the route level.
    Input Validation: Protects against malicious input.
    Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage.
    Environment Configuration: Securely manages sensitive settings.

‚öôÔ∏è Database Strategy

    Single Database: Streamlined data management.
    Connection Pooling: Optimizes database performance and resource utilization.

üí° Development Guidelines

For contributors and future development, keep these in mind:

    Always include __init__.py in directories you intend to import from.
    Start all imports from the root package (e.g., app.etc).
    Run the application from the root directory of the project.
    Prefer absolute imports for clarity and consistency.
